# Rich NcDump [:link:](https://ncdump-rich.readthedocs.io/)

**Rich NcDump** is a repository made to be able to quickly preview
`netCDF` files. It is useful when you just want to see the metadata,
and it is packaged with `pip`!

To install, you can simply do

```bash
pip install ncdump-rich
```

or even better, by using
[`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) which
installs it in a nice, isolated
environment:

```bash
pipx install ncdump-rich
```

If you are like me and you think browsing through your files is a lot easier in a
terminal file manager compared to Finder, Nautilus and so on, then this previewer
fits perfectly into the previwing plugins that exists for for example
[nnn](https://github.com/jarun/nnn) and [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf).
