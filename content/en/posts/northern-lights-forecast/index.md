<!-- # [Northern Lights Forecast](https://github.com/engeir/northern-lights-forecast) -->

**nlf ‚Äî Norther Lights Forecast**
[:link:](https://github.com/engeir/northern-lights-forecast) sends alerts to the
telegram bot `@NorthernLightsForecastBot` whenever there are good chances of seeing
northern lights near Troms√∏. The program itself can actually check the conditions in a
number of places (see the full list by running `nlf --locations`), but the instance I
have running on a raspberry pi that updates telegram is looking only at Troms√∏. Install
and run your own version by cloning and installing with `poetry`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/engeir/northern-lights-forecast.git
poetry install
# Install tesseract and create a telegram bot, then run
nlf -l Troms√∏
```
